CurrentCost_dump is a small tool I have written to be able to dump raw XML from the CurrentCost EnviR electricity monitor. It depends on libxml2 and ctb.

Installing libxml2 is just a matter of "sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev".

Ctb is a different case:
First, download it from <URL: https://iftools.com/download/ctb/0.16/libctb-0.16.tar.gz >
"gunzip libctb-0.16.tar.gz" to gunzip it.
"tar xf libctb-0.16.tar" to untar it
"cd libctb-0.16/samples/"
add "#include "/usr/include/getopt.h"" at the top of the file ctbtest.cpp to be able to compile later on..
"cd ../build/"
add "-I../include/ctb-0.16/ -I/usr/include/" to CPPFLAGS in the file GNUmakefile
"make -f GNUmakefile DEBUG=0 GPIB=0" to compile it. (And compile it one more time, with DEBUG=1, to be able to debug the application)
"sudo make -f GNUmakefile DEBUG=0 GPIB=0 install" to install it. (And, once more, install it with DEBUG=1 to be able to link a debug version of the application) 
"sudo cp ../include/ctb-0.16/kbhit.h /usr/local/include/ctb-0.16/" to install a header-file the ctb makefile seems to have forgotten..
Finally "sudo ldconfig" to update the cache


To compile CurrentCost_dump, just type "make && sudo make install". Run the tool as root/sudo or a user in the "dialout" group.
